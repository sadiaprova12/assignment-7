    <h1>Question And Answer?</h1>
    <h3> 1. When to use .forEach() ? </h3>
    <p>Answer: .forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. .forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. Good practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can’t use other array methods to accomplish your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic tool… only use it when you can’t use a more specialized tool.</p>
    <h3> 2. When to use .filter() ? </h3>
    <p>Answer: .filter checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. .filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.</p>
    <h3> 3. When to use .map() ? </h3>
    <p>Answer: .map() when you want to transform elements in an array. .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</p>
    <h3> 4. When to use .find() ?</h3>
    <p>Answer: .find() When you want to select a single element from an array. </p> </ol>
