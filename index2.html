    <h1>Question And Answer?</h1>
    <h3> 1. When to use .forEach() ? </h3>
    <p>Answer: .forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. .forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. Good practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can’t use other array methods to accomplish your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic tool… only use it when you can’t use a more specialized tool.</p>
    <h3> 2. When to use .filter() ? </h3>
    <p>Answer: .filter checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. .filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.</p>
    <h3> 3. When to use .map() ? </h3>
    <p>Answer: .map() when you want to transform elements in an array. .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</p>
    <h3> 4. When to use .find() ?</h3>
    <p>Answer: .find() When you want to select a single element from an array. </p>
    <h1>1--Whats difference with Map, Filter, ForEach, Find ?</h1>
<p>Answer:<br>The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method returns undefined and map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same job, the returning value remains different.filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the condition, but find() returns the element itself that satisfies the condition. In filter() , whole array is iterated despite the fact that the element being searched for is present at the beginning.</p>
<h1>2--Whats difference with LocalStorage, Cookige, SectionStorage ?</h1>
<p>Answer:<br>Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications. Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.</p>
<h1>3--Whats Eventloop and how it work?</h1>
<p>Answer:<br> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external event provider that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived, then calls the relevant event handler.</p>
<h1>Function-1---QuizTimer :</h1>
<p>Answer:quizTimer is a function,there many function work.First we get element id,then we set some math,convert,function,condition,color etc.Then we set all text information to innerHTML with HTML page.</p>

<h1>Function-2---ChooseQuiz :</h1>
<p>Answer: chooseQuiz is a function.This function we can set our select or choose right ans and get output results.All function work some condition like if-else,for-loop,display-display function work-first function get user value to right or wrong ans of if-else condition  then it set to innerHTML.Then we can get proper results output to our main wep page.</p>
